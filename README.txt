WHAT IT DOES
The player controls the direction of the snake's movement with the arrow keys. The objective is to direct the snake to eat the "apple",
which will increase the length of the snake as well as speed up the snake's movement. If the snake hits an outer wall or itself, the game ends.

WHAT I LEARNED
Became more familiar time intervals, event listeners, and editing the DOM directly with vanilla JavaScript.
